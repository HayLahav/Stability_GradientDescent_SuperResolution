# Stability Analysis of Gradient Descent in Super-Resolution: From Theory to Practice

This repository provides a comprehensive theoretical-to-practical implementation of stability analysis for neural networks, specifically applying Lecture 8 stability theorems from Advanced Topics in Learning to real super-resolution tasks. The project bridges abstract mathematical theory with practical machine learning through both interactive Google Colab exploration and production-ready local implementation.

## üéØ **Project Overview**

This work represents a complete educational and research framework that demonstrates how to apply academic stability theory to real neural network design. We implement and validate theoretical stability bounds (Theorems 8.1, 8.3, 8.5) through systematic experiments on super-resolution models, providing both research contributions and pedagogical value.

### **üî¨ Core Research Contributions**

- First comprehensive empirical validation of Lecture 8 stability bounds for neural networks
- Additive component modeling approach superior to traditional multiplicative approaches
- Empirical calibration framework (0.4√ó factor) maintaining theoretical rigor while improving practical utility
- Progressive complexity analysis across 7 architectural configurations
- Complete theory-practice integration methodology for stability-aware ML system design

## üìä **Comprehensive Experiment Framework**

The project executes 35 systematic experiments across:
- **7 progressive configurations**: baseline ‚Üí correction filter ‚Üí AdaFM layers ‚Üí AdaFM optimizer ‚Üí combinations ‚Üí full system
- **5 sample sizes**: 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 30,000 samples

- Efficient implementation optimized for local hardware
- Extensible framework for custom research
- Batch experiment execution scripts
- Production deployment capabilities

### **üîÑ Relationship Between Implementations**

Both implementations share the same core research methodology and theoretical foundations but are optimized for different use cases:

- **Colab**: Optimized for interactive learning, research exploration, and comprehensive analysis with educational structure and memory constraints
- **Local**: Optimized for production deployment, custom development, and scalable experiments with modular architecture and performance focus

  ## üéì **Theoretical Background & Research Impact**

### **Theoretical Foundation**

The implementation validates key results from Lecture 8 on Stability Analysis:

**Strongly Convex Case (Theorem 8.1)**:
Œ≥(m) = O(L¬≤/(Œ±‚àöT) + L¬≤/(Œ±m))

**General Case (Theorem 8.3)**:
Œ≥(m) = 4Œ∑L¬≤‚àöT + 4Œ∑L¬≤T/m

**Smooth Case (Theorem 8.5)**:
Œ≥(m) = 2Œ∑TL¬≤/m

Where Œ≥(m) is the stability parameter, T is iterations, m is sample size, Œ∑ is learning rate, L is Lipschitz constant, and Œ± is strong convexity parameter.

### **Main Contributions**

1. **Empirical Calibration Methodology**: Framework for making theoretical stability bounds practically useful
